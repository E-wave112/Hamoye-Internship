This is a reformatted version of the hamoye lesson notes from 2 to 5 in a manner that i hope will clear all confusion concerning the coding with a few personal insights as well
suggestions and corrections are very welcome.

 # Fuel Quality Data Exploration
Hi, again its Adedayo and i am very grateful to be part the the Hamoye intenship, we were given a data set and asked to explore every nook and cranny of it and i !!! 
This notebook is an oppurtunity for me  to seek for advise and opinions from all my colleagues and the Hamoye instructors on my approach to this dataset,

## I want to know if,
 * the questions I asked were good ones?
 *  the analysis method i useds were adequate?
 *  you have a better  analysis option?
 *  the observations were accurate?
 *  you have more observations? 
 *  you agree with my insights and suggestions?
 *  you don't agree? Please tell me why.

 # Stage B Hamoye Intenship Lesson Notes
Hi, its Adedayo again, I think the note structure this time around is a great outline line for studying because I had to go through some topics that I would have normally ignored or chosen a black box approach to them without bothering to learn the inner workings, so an outline really removes all excuses. This is a jupyter notebook containing a reformat of the lessons and code from lesson 1 to 5 and in a manner I hope you think is clear and consise, it is mostly the same as the lesson notes with a few added personal insights, I am not an expert by means so I encourage you correct me if i am wrong in some areas and give new insights so I can improve this notebook I will also be including links to useful resources for further reading
## Goals I gave my self
* I told my self i would not attach any image to the notebooks to ensure I find a code that gives the approximate result as the note drawing, so please cross reference with your notes
* In the same vein as the above resolve i tried to use the oppurtunity to pratcice my Markdown and LaTex,instead of copy- pasting equation images
* This will only serve as a study guide i will go back and further revise articles and videos on the individuals
* if neither of the first two options are available i will link an article with the exact image used in the notes.
 
 
 #### I also want everyone to pick up something new from these notebooks
